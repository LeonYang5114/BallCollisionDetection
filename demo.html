		- Reset: reset the balls to their original positions and velocities. (notice that freshing the page will generate a random set of balls!)<br/>
		- Start Animation: start the animation if the canvas is currently paused.<br/>
		- Pause: you can pause at any time! but that might not be very helpful if you want to see if ball sets with different update intervals will match.<br/>
		- Pause to Match: If checked, the canvas will pause every time all ball sets have updated the same number of time units. They are suppose to match with each other!<br/>
			<p>
			Currently there are three ball sets with interval 20, 200, and 2000 "time units." It just means that the last set predicts where the balls will be 
			after the first set has updated 100 times. The algorithm works fine for the first 10000 time units, but after that, some tiny mismatches rampant into total chaos. 
			What a bufferfly effect! The reason for that is not clear. I think the algorithm should not to be blamed for, since many assumptions are verified (i.e. every 
			collision happens when two ball's distance exactly equals to their sum of radius). It might be that the float point numbers have rounding errors which build up
			to big ones. It will be great if anyone have a good idea to check that.</p>
			<p>
			The collision algorithm does not use grids for optimization, which is actually suggested by so many people online. However, grids is not reliable for high 
			precision collision detection, since it does not take into account the velocities of the balls, which would lead to big mistake if the update interval is big.</p>
			<p>
			Instead, my algorithm use a very simple way to "filter" those unnecessary calls for checking collision time. As we know, finding the collision time of two given 
			balls is actually <a href="http://garethrees.org/2009/02/17/physics/">solving a quadratic function</a>. Since we know the signs of the three coefficients: coef_a 
			is always positive (square of their relative speed), coef_b always negative (so that the collision time is always positive), and coef_c always non-negative (
			related to the "gap" between the two balls). If the mathematics here is not so intuitive and you are so interested in it, I will be happy to explain more. But 
			the most interesting part is (which I haven't seen anyone mentioned before), knowing the shape of that quadratic function on the coordinate, we know that 
			the tangent line at its intersect with the y-axis must intersect with the x-axis to the very left of the smaller root (the one we want). And since the 
			parabola is usually very flat (small coef_a), that intersect of the tangent line would be a great estimation. Guess what is the expression for that 
			intersection? Just -coef_c/coef_b! Not time consuming at all and can efficiently filter out any pair of balls that would not potentially collide in the given 
			update interval. And this is solid reliable! (although not working well for large update interval. but anyway, not optimization works in that case).</p>
			<p>
			As usual, the code is not very well documented, which I expressed my high apology. I am trying to do better. If you are interested, please recommend this 
			to your friends or contact me if you have any idea to share!</p>
